# AMLA

Greetings!

We infer and reproduce state-of-the-art models from Meta AI, Open AI, and Google.

Because closed-source models and blackbox AI increase the Barriers to Entry, we use a non-blackbox approach aiming to replicate and simplify complex models in a way that undergrad students can easily understand.
